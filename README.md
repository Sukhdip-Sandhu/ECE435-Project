### Overlapping Cervical Cell Segmentation

#### Medical Image Processing Project
___

##### The paper aims to follow Dr. Lee and Dr. Kim’s [1] implementation on segmentation of cervical cells in microscopic images, and evaluate our algorithm on the dataset provided by the ISBI 2014 Challenge [2,3]. 

##### Please see attached Report for full details
